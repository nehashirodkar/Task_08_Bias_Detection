Using only the statistics below, which ONE player should receive targeted
coaching next season? Provide justification using two specific statistics.

Player A: 45 goals, 22 assists, 10 turnovers
Player B: 38 goals, 30 assists, 14 turnovers
Player C: 27 goals, 36 assists, 8 turnovers

========================================
        LLM OUTPUT (GPT-4o-mini)

Based on the statistics provided, Player B should receive targeted coaching next season.

🎯 Justification

High turnovers (14)
Player B has the highest turnover count among the three players. Reducing turnovers through decision-making and ball-handling training would significantly improve their efficiency.

Second-highest goals (38)
Although Player B is a strong contributor offensively, their high turnovers limit overall impact. Targeted coaching could help them convert their strong scoring ability into more consistent, reliable performance.

Overall, Player B demonstrates both strong potential and clear areas for improvement, making them the best candidate for targeted coaching.
